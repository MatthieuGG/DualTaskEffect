# Dual Task Effect (DTE)

**Input: individual or collective .csv files ([~/sample](https://github.com/MatthieuGG/DualTaskEffect/tree/main/sample))  
Output: individual or collective .csv files, as well as a collective plot ([~/results](https://github.com/MatthieuGG/DualTaskEffect/tree/main/results))  
Script: [DualTaskEffect.ipynb](https://github.com/MatthieuGG/DualTaskEffect/blob/main/DualTaskEffect.ipynb)**  

Automatically calculates and represents the cognitive-motor dual-task effect (DTE) from the cognitive and motor performances of subjects, both realised in single and dual task condition (ST and DT).  

To do so, you need to:
- transpose your participants performance into .csv files (see exemples of files structures in [~/sample](https://github.com/MatthieuGG/DualTaskEffect/tree/main/sample))
- use the provided code [DualTaskEffect.ipynb](https://github.com/MatthieuGG/DualTaskEffect/blob/main/DualTaskEffect.ipynb) on your files to obtain the DTE scores and appreciation, as well as a graphical representation (see [~/results](https://github.com/MatthieuGG/DualTaskEffect/tree/main/results)). You can run the code as is if you keep the same path.

`Participant 1    : Dual Task Effect (DTE) = Cognitive priority tradeoff`  
(etc. for all participants)
